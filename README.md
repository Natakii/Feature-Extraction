Features Engineering
Feature engineering is the creation of new input or target features from existing features. The objective is to create ones that do a better job of representing a machine learning problem to the model. By doing so, you can improve the accuracy of the model.
Good feature engineering can be the difference between a poor model and a fantastic one! More often than not, you will find that you can squeeze more out of your models through careful feature selection than any amount of algorithm tuning.
